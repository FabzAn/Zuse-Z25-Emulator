# Zuse-Z25-Emulator
An emulator for the computer Zuse Z25 from 1963.

This is a Unity project, done for my bachelor thesis. That's why all of the files are (more or less) in german.

There is no compiled version of on this repo (yet), so you will need Unity to compile. Open the UnityProject folder in as project in Unity and build.
