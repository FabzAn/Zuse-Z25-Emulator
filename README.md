# Zuse-Z25-Emulator
An emulator for the computer Zuse Z25 from 1963.

This is a Unity project, done for my bachelor thesis. That's why all of the files are (more or less) in german.

There is a compiled version in the folder "Windows Desktop Build". I use Windows code (for saving and loading) so it probably won't work on Mac or Linux.
